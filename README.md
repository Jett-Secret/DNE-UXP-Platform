# DNE Platform
This is a clone of the UXP (not goanna) platform for palemoon.  This platform exists as palemoon, during the development of DNE Beta, switched to Goanna, not UXP, and I did not update before completion.  Some future work will attempt to switch to Goanna, but this will be considered legacy and will monitory with the original UXP.  Hence, this repo exists only to ensure that the DNE soruce code builds and runs correctly.

# Unified XUL Platform (UXP)

This repository holds the code for a unified application platform for XUL-based
applications. It is a hard fork from the Mozilla code repository (mozilla-central)
with an ESR-52 fork point.

In addition to further development based on the Mozilla upstream code, and
selective cherry-picking of directly-applicable patches, this repository has its
own development and holds the base for a maintained platform to be used by XUL
applications.
